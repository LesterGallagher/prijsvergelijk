My main focus when I'm writing a web-app, is to make the web-app responsive, learn about new tools and trying to use new techniques. SPA's, Build tools and other front-end tools are things i would like to learn more about. I mostly end up using some sort of combination of Node js tools to build the front-end of a web-app.
